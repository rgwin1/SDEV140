# Step 1: Define the function `myRange` to mimic Python’s built-in `range` function.

# Step 2: Accept up to three parameters (start, stop, step), setting default values as needed.

# Step 3: Use a default value of `None` for optional parameters to determine how many arguments were provided.

# Step 4: Check if only one argument is provided, meaning it represents `stop`, and set `start` to 0.

# Step 5: Check if `step` is not provided (is `None`), and set it to 1 for counting up.

# Step 6: Create an empty list to store the sequence of numbers.

# Step 7: Use a loop to generate numbers, following Python’s `range` logic:
#         - If `step` is positive, count up to `stop` (but not including `stop`).
#         - If `step` is negative, count down to `stop` (but not including `stop`).

# Step 8: Append each generated number to the list.

# Step 9: Return the final list.

# Step 10: Create a test script to validate the function:
#          - Test `myRange` with one argument (`stop` only).
#          - Test `myRange` with two arguments (`start`, `stop`).
#          - Test `myRange` with three arguments (`start`, `stop`, `step`).
#          - Test `myRange` with negative step values.

# Step 11: Print the test results to verify correctness.

# Step 12: Run the script in IDLE to check outputs.

# Step 1: Import the necessary module for generating random numbers.

# Step 2: Define a function to handle the game logic.

# Step 3: Inside the function, generate a random number between 1 and 100.

# Step 4: Create a loop that allows the user to keep guessing until they get the correct number.

# Step 5: Prompt the user for input and store their guess.

# Step 6: Convert the user input to an integer for comparison.

# Step 7: Check if the guess is higher, lower, or correct:
#         - If higher, display "Too high, try again."
#         - If lower, display "Too low, try again."
#         - If correct, congratulate the user.

# Step 8: If the user guesses correctly, generate a new random number 
#         and restart the game loop automatically.

# Step 9: Ensure the program continues running, allowing multiple rounds of play.

# Step 10: Call the function to start the game.

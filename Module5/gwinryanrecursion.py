# Step 1: Define the recursive function that prints elements from a sequence (string, tuple, or list).

# Step 2: The function should accept only one argument: the sequence to be printed.

# Step 3: Check if the sequence is empty:
#         - If empty, stop recursion (base case).
#         - If not empty, print the first element and recursively call the function with the rest of the sequence.

# Step 4: Before each recursive call, ensure the function slices the sequence from index `1:` to remove the first item.

# Step 5: Implement a test script (`testprintlist.py`) to verify the function:
#         - Test with a list of numbers.
#         - Test with a tuple of strings.
#         - Test with a string (to print characters one by one).
#         - Observe and verify if the output matches expected results.

# Step 6: Add tracing statements to monitor the argument on each recursive call.

# Step 7: Run the script to determine if the function works as expected.

# Step 8: Analyze the hidden costs:
#         - Each recursive call creates a new slice, which is a copy of the original sequence minus the first element.
#         - Copying the list repeatedly consumes both time and memory.
#         - The function is not **in-place** since it works on new copies rather than modifying the original list.

# Step 9: Consider whether recursion is necessary:
#         - Recognize that recursion is an alternative to loops, but not required.
#         - A loop could achieve the same goal without the overhead of multiple function calls and list slicing.

# Step 10: Conclude whether recursion is the best approach or if a loop would be more efficient.
